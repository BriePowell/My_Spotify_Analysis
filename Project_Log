I. Set-up, Prep, Plan
The first surprise is that the data provided by spotify is nothing like what I was expecting. It's a JSON file, which I have not used,
and doesn't include a genre key, which was a cornerstone of my planned analysis. 

Found a dataset of tracks from 1959 - 2010's, it might be able to join that csv with my own data to flesh out the track data from my history.

I realized tableau can process JSON files, so I loaded my datasets in and started looking around.

 a) Initial Observation: It's easy to ponit out tracks in the shared data that I don't recognize. But my sister and I share such similar musical tastes that it's harder to 
   determine my plays from hers. We both listen to R&B, I can guess that Paramore is an artist I listen to, but I cannot rule out that she does too. My podcasts are a dead give
   away, but I only started listening on spotify after the apple platform got all wonky, not a metric of when I started using the account. The high frequency of Beyonce is 
   definitely partially my doing, but she also enjoyes Beyonce, so I can't separate my habits from her's.

After a PAINFUL transition process after upgraing my computer, I was able to convert the JOSON data into a csv file through Tableau. I would like to learn how to do 
something similar with code...but it was more important that I complete the analysis.

I have begun to clean and evaluate the data. Worth remembering that I will have to do this again for "my" dataset. I can either try evaluating the data as is or clean it further. 
It feels stupid to try and perform any analysis knowing that I will need to parse and format it.
